        <h1>Prince was the youngest out of his 5 siblings. His mother and father are both wonderful and lively.<br>
            One day it was raining heavily in Ontario, Canada and Prince found himself approached by a wolf.<br>
            Our young sheep ran from the wolf as fast as he can. He eventually lost the wolf, but he did not know where <br>
            he was or how to get back home.He was lost,cold and lonely. His family discovered he was gone and <br>
            searched frantically all over for Prince. He was nowhere to be found. Prince searched and searched<br>
            for his family but could not find them. A year passed and the family slowly lost hope and assumed<br>
            the worst. The grief and torment left a great sorrow within the family's heart and they decided <br>
            to move away from Canada for they could not bear the pain of losing their youngest.<br>

            Months later our little Prince found his way back to his home but to his surprise his family had<br>
            moved. Prince recalled memories of places that the family wanted to go to. Prince embarked on<br>
            a journey to find his family and his first stop was New Orleans,Louisiana, the Crescent city.
